With 11-car trains, some cars stop inside a tunnel, so certain doors do not open.\n- On the Yokosuka Station side of JR Taura Station, three adjacent tunnels from three eras can be seen from the station overpass: the oldest (down line) completed in 1889 (Meiji era), a brick-built tunnel added in 1924 (Taisho era) for double-tracking, and the largest tunnel built in 1943 (Showa era) for wartime military freight.\n- The area name is historically “Shikkama” (literally “lost sickle”), and the tunnel name is said to use the homophone “Shikkama” written as “Shikkama / Shikkama (Seven Kettles)” to avoid the unlucky association of “losing a boiler (kama)” for steam locomotives.\n\nAttention:\n- No parking is available.\n- Accessibility support is very limited (e.g., no elevators/escalators; wheelchair-accessible toilet and other related facilities are not available).\n- When boarding/alighting, follow station guidance because some doors may remain closed due to the short platform.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/taura-st.html\n\nTags: yokosuka, taura, railway, tunnel, history, architecture, meiji, taisho, showa, trainspotting"

Tradition holds that, as Kinugasa Castle neared collapse, members of the Miura clan escaped via a back route to this area, then sailed toward Awa (Bōsō Peninsula). The toponym **“Funakura”** (“boat storehouse/harbor”) remains as a trace of where boats were hidden or moored.\n- **Fortification & terrain:** The castle reportedly took advantage of natural landforms—described as steep and difficult to approach on three sides, with a single route opening toward the sea—making it a highly defensible position.\n- **Archaeology & designation:** Today the area is protected as a Kanagawa Prefecture–designated historic site, **“Ruins centered on the Yoshii Shell Midden.”** Excavations identified multiple shell-midden locations and settlement traces spanning the Jōmon period and later eras, with the broader plateau also considered the likely location of the late-Heian mountain castle.\n\nAttention:\n- **No parking** on site.\n- **Access:** About a **20-minute walk** from **Keikyu Kurihama Station** or **JR Kurihama Station**.\n- **Barrier-free:** Facilities are largely unavailable (no elevator/escalator/ramps; no accessible toilet; no wheelchair rental; no diaper-changing/universal sheet; no designated accessible parking; no tactile guidance blocks).\n- As an archaeological/historic area, please respect signs, surrounding residences, and the landscape.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/nutazyoushi.html\n- Yokosuka Tourist Information Center (09:30–17:00): +81-46-822-8301\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, castle-ruins, miura-clan, samurai-history, archaeology, jomon-period, shell-midden, historic-site, walk-from-station"

A local custom mentioned in the guide is to place a magatama charm from West Kano Shrine inside a protective pouch from East Kano Shrine to support good relationships (including romance).\n- Historically, the enshrined deity is Emperor Ōjin (the same as Iwashimizu Hachimangū in Kyoto). The shrine is said to have begun on August 15, 1181, when the monk Mongaku invited the spirit of Iwashimizu Hachimangū while praying for the revival of the Genji; later, Minamoto no Yoritomo’s success led to the name “Kano Daimyōjin.”\n- The wooded hill behind the shrine is Myojin-yama (about 50 meters high). It has an inner shrine (okumiya) near the summit and a marker for “Kaishū Katsu’s fasting place.”\n- The Myojin-yama area is valued for its well-preserved natural forest and biodiversity; the ubamegashi (Quercus phillyraeoides) here is noted as a northern distribution limit in the prefecture. The grove is designated as a Prefectural Natural Monument (“Kano Shrine Shaso-rin”).\n\nAttention:\n- Accessibility: the site lists no elevator/escalator and no ramp/slope measures, and indicates that the route from the “Shinmachi” bus stop includes stairs.\n- Parking is limited to 10 cars.\n\nLink:\n- Yokosuka tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/higashi-kanou-z.html\n- Official site: http://jinjya.net\n\nTags: yokosuka, uraga, shrine, kano-shrine, history-and-culture, power-spot, myojinyama, komainu, ferry-crossing"

It has long been worshiped across the Miura Peninsula since at least the Edo period, especially as a shrine for matchmaking and safe voyages.\n- A well-known local rite is to dedicate a *bottomless ladle* (a ladle with the bottom removed) tied with hemp. This custom expresses prayers for safe childbirth—“as water drains out, may the birth go smoothly”—and is held on March 3.\n- During the festival, Shinto priests and shrine maidens board a boat from Ashina Beach in front of the shrine and perform a “floating hina dolls” ritual (nagashi-bina).\n- The west coast area of Yokosuka has several related spots connected with safe childbirth and matchmaking, such as Junisho Shrine and Akiya’s “Kosan-ishi” (Childbirth Stone).\n- Access (public transit): From Keikyu Shin-Zushi Station, take a bus toward Nagai (e.g., bound for Yokosuka City Hospital or Nagai; about 25 minutes).

It was built in 1648 by order of the shogunate, and its rapeseed-oil lamp was said to be visible up to about 4 nautical miles (7.4 km) offshore.\n- From the Genroku era onward, it was maintained at the expense of East Uraga's dried-sardine (hoshi-iwashi) wholesalers. It reportedly operated every day for about 220 years, protecting the shipping route until it was abolished in 1872.\n- The original structure remained into the 1880s but later collapsed due to weather, leaving only the stone base. In 1988, the current building was reconstructed on the remaining stonework to match the historical exterior.\n- A small sandy beach stretches from Tomyodo, and you can still see many vessels passing offshore today.\n- Admission: Free.\n- Access: From Keikyu Uraga Station, take a bus bound for Keikyu Kurihama Station via Chiyogasaki (about 8 minutes). Get off at “Tomyodo Iriguchi” bus stop, then walk about 5 minutes.\n- Parking: Nearby “Tomyodo Green Space” parking is available.\n- Contact: Yokosuka Tourist Information Center (Tel: +81-46-822-8301, 9:30–17:00).\n\nAttention:\n- Accessibility (barrier-free): Not well equipped. No elevator or escalator, and no slope/step-free entrance measures are listed. No accessible toilet, no ostomate toilet, no wheelchair rental, no diaper-changing sheet, and no universal (adult) changing sheet. There is one dedicated parking space for people with disabilities, but no guidance blocks are listed.\n- If you need step-free access or accessible restrooms, plan accordingly and consider checking the latest conditions before visiting.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/toumyoudou.html\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Uraga, Tomyodo, lighthouse, historic site, coastal walk, free admission, Kanagawa"

Rivers such as the **Miyama River** and **Ōyato River** are thought to have functioned as natural defensive lines.\n- The site is closely tied to the **Battle of Kinugasa (1180)**, when a much larger Taira (Heike) force attacked the Miura defenders—an episode connected to the opening era of the Kamakura period.\n- Today it is mainly enjoyed as a **short historical hike / walk**, with points of interest including:\n- **“Uma-kaeshi no Saka” (Horse-turning Slope):** a notably steep ascent on the route toward the main area.\n- **Fudō Waterfall (Fudō no Taki):** a spring/water spot below Daizen-ji, linked to a local legend and considered important for daily and defensive water use.\n- **Momiiwa (Lookout Rock):** a large boulder said to have been used to observe and direct the battle; artifacts were reportedly found nearby during early 20th‑century site works.\n- **Yatake bamboo (arrow bamboo):** bamboo historically used as arrow material; the surrounding “Yabe” place-name is associated with arrow-making traditions.\n- **Seki Jizō (Cough Jizō):** a small Jizō statue tied to a story from the battle; locally associated with relief from coughs.\n- **Karamete-guchi (rear gate route):** a narrow cut-through path said to have been heavily defended; nearby are traces of earthworks, training-ground areas, and old wells.\n\nAttention:\n- **No parking available.**\n- The route inside the historic area is **unpaved** and includes **steep slopes and stairs**—wear shoes with good grip and allow extra time.\n- Barrier-free facilities are essentially **not available** (e.g., no elevators/escalators; no wheelchair-accessible toilets or rentals).

    "text": "Title: West Kano Shrine (Nishi Kano Jinja) — Uraga, Yokosuka (Kanagawa, Japan)\n\nDatetime:\n- 12/26/25, 8:39 PM (page capture timestamp)\n\nPlace:\n- West Kano Shrine (Nishi Kano Jinja)\n- Address: 1-1-13 Nishi-Uraga, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239-0824, Japan\n\nDetail:\n- **Overview / origin:** The shrine is associated with the title “Kano Myojin” (“the deity that grants wishes”). Tradition says the monk Mongaku prayed for the revival of the Minamoto clan by enshrining (inviting) the spirit of Iwashimizu Hachimangu; after the wish was fulfilled, the shrine received the title “Kano Myojin.” It is said to have begun in 1181, and the enshrined deity is Emperor Ojin (as with Iwashimizu Hachimangu).\n- **Architecture & craftsmanship:** The current shrine building was rebuilt in 1842 (after a loss in 1837). A major highlight is the extremely elaborate interior decoration, including more than 230 carvings around the shrine precincts, attributed to the Awa sculptor Goto Rihei. Look for the coffered ceiling carvings of flowers and birds (including motifs believed not to have existed in Japan at the time), and try to find the hidden wrestler figure said to be supporting a ridgepost.\n- **Komainu (guardian dogs):** The komainu in front of the shrine appear to have open mouths on both sides. There is also a “hidden” cute komainu—partly concealed near a pillar—so keep an eye out.\n- **Plaster relief art (Kote-e):** At the entrance of the shrine office, there is a white relief decoration made with trowel-and-plaster technique (“kote-e”). It is said to be a work from 1930 (Showa 5) by Ishikawa Zenkichi, a nationally known master of plaster craft (“Miura no Zenkichi”).\n- **Power-spot style visit:** The shrine is popular as a “wish-granting” spot. A local practice says that if you place West Kano Shrine’s magatama (comma-shaped jewel) into the amulet pouch from East Kano Shrine and carry it with you, it may help bring good relationships (including romance). The East and West Kano Shrines are connected by the “Uraga no Watashi” ferry that crosses Uraga harbor.\n- **Festival culture:** A tiger dance (Tora Odori), designated as an intangible folk cultural property, is offered at the annual festival in September and is said to have been passed down locally since 1720.\n- **Nearby historical notes:** A monument commemorates Emperor Meiji resting here on May 18, 1881, when he came to observe the construction progress of the Kannonzaki battery.\n\nAttention:\n- **Hours:** 8:30–17:00 (worship/prayer is possible all day). No regular closing days.\n- **Access by transit:** From Keikyu Uraga Station, take a bus toward Kurihama Station (~5 min), get off at “Konyamachi,” then walk ~1 minute.\n- **Accessibility:** The site information indicates no elevator/escalator and no ramp/step-free entrance measures. There is no wheelchair-accessible toilet or wheelchair rental listed. The route from Konyamachi bus stop includes stairs.\n- **Suggested itinerary:** If you want to try the magatama + amulet tradition, plan to visit both West and East Kano Shrines and use the Uraga ferry connection.\n\nLink:\n- Yokosuka tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/nishi-kanou-z.html\n- Official site: https://kanoujinjya.jp/\n\nTags: #Yokosuka, #Uraga, #Shrine, #Hachiman, #History, #Carvings, #Komainu, #PowerSpot, #TigerDance, #AccessibleTravel"

The lightning struck a nearby Byakushin (juniper) tree, charring it black, yet the maidens were unharmed.\n- On Tsukishima, the Byakushin tree remains as a sacred tree. The area was once an inlet, and Tsukishima was a small island within salt fields. Behind the “Ikazuchi Shrine Former Site Monument” (built in 1931 / Shōwa 6), there used to be a small pond.\n- In the shrine precincts, a large ginkgo tree (over 500 years old) is revered; its hanging “breast-shaped” growths are objects of faith for safe childbirth and childrearing.\n\nAttention:\n- Access: From Keikyū Oppama Station, walk about 5 minutes toward Yokohama along Route 16.\n- Barrier-free notes: A ramp/step-free detour route to the main hall exists, but it is a steep slope; visiting by wheelchair requires assistance. Elevators/escalators are not available, and wheelchair-accessible toilets and other related facilities are not provided.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/ikazuti-z.html\n- Official site: https://kaminarijinja.com/\n\nTags: yokosuka, oppama, taura, shrine, history, legend, sacred-tree, ginkgo, accessibility"

After the war, it became a municipal cemetery, and an additional area was developed for local residents who did not have their own burial plots.\n- The site covers roughly 25,000 m² of hilly terrain and is arranged in three terraced levels. The lower and middle terraces mainly contain graves of enlisted personnel, with orderly rows of headstones. The upper terrace, covered with lawn, includes seven memorial towers (cenotaphs) and graves of officers.\n- Notable memorials include cenotaphs for victims of major naval incidents and conflicts (e.g., warship disasters and wartime casualties), reflecting Yokosuka’s historical role as a core naval hub.\n- A memorial service is held every year in May.\n\nAttention:\n- Admission is free.\n- Opening hours: 08:30–17:00 (extended hours during Obon: 08:00–18:00; during the equinoctial weeks: 08:00–17:30).\n- No parking is available on site.\n- Accessibility: there is a slope that allows access up to the cemetery entrance, but elevators/escalators are not available and wheelchair-accessible toilets are not provided.\n- This is a cemetery and memorial site—please behave respectfully (quiet voices, no littering, and follow any on-site rules).\n- Contact (Yokosuka City Health General Affairs Division): Tel +81-46-824-7502 / Email hga-hd@city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/mamonzan.html\n- http://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/3110/sisetu/fc00001136.html\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Kanagawa, History, Culture, Memorial, Navy, Cemetery, Accessible-route-to-entrance"

Takatori (Elevation: 139 m), Oppama / Taura area, Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan\n\nDetail:\n- Mt. Takatori is a 139-meter rocky mountain known for steep cliffs, sometimes nicknamed “Shonan Myogi” because its rugged silhouette resembles Mt. Myogi in Gunma.\n- On the rock face, a giant image of **Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva)** is carved directly into the cliff. It was created by Yokosuka-based sculptor **Shigeru Fujishima**, starting in 1960 (Showa 35), and took about a year to complete.\n- The carving is massive: approximately **8 m tall** and **4.5 m wide**.\n- A separate cliff-carved statue of **Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathagata)** once existed, but it was demolished in 1965 (Showa 40) due to the construction of Takatori Elementary School.\n- The mountain’s soft tuff rock (common in Yokosuka) was historically quarried as “Takatori stone” for construction materials, which helped create the dramatic vertical rock walls seen today.\n- Numerous small holes on the rock surface are said to be traces of pitons driven in for climbing practice.\n\nAttention:\n- **No parking available.**\n- Accessibility is limited: the site is **not barrier-free** (no elevators, escalators, ramps), and there are **no wheelchair-accessible toilets**, ostomate toilets, wheelchair rentals, diaper-changing sheets, universal changing sheets, accessible parking spaces, or tactile paving blocks.\n\nLink:\n- Tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/magaibutu.html\n- Yokosuka City (official): http://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/5560/sisetu/fc00000978.html\n- Contact (Yokosuka City Park Management Division): Tel +81-46-822-8333 / Email pa-ep@city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, takatori-yama, oppama, taura, magaibutsu, cliff-carving, buddhist-art, hiking, history"
